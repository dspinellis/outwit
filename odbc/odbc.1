.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIOdbc\fP 
prints the results of an \fISQL select\fP command
run on any database for which an appropriate data source has been defined.
Two arguments must always be specified as part of the \fIodbc\fP invocation:
the name of the data source driver, and an SQL select statement.
Data source drivers are typically configured through the
control panel (ODBC category).
All data types are currently output as text according to the default
driver-supplied data conversions.
By default fields are separated by  the tab character and records by a
newline.
To access the database an empty user identifier and authorization string
are used.
The select statement specified must conform to the syntax and conventions used
by the database being accessed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-R\fP \fBRS\fP"
Specify the record separator used to delimit records on output.
The default record separator is a newline.
.IP "\fB\-F\fP \fBFS\fP"
Specify the field separator used to delimit fields on output.
The default field separator is a tab.
.IP "\fB\-u\fP \fBUID\fP"
Specify the user identifier used to access the database.
An empty user identifier is used if none is specified.
.IP "\fB\-s\fP \fBAS\fP"
Specify the authorization string (often the password)
used to access the database.
An empty authorization string is used if none is specified.
.IP "\fB\-h\fP"
The first line of the output will contain the name of each database field.

.SH EXAMPLE
mail `odbc userDB "select email from users"` <message
.br
Extracts the email address from all records from the table \fIusers\fP
which is part of the database \fIuserDB\fP and sends them the file
\fImessage\fP by email.
