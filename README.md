_Outwit_ is a suite of tools based on the Unix tool design
principles allowing the processing of Windows application data with
sophisticated data manipulation pipelines.
The _outwit_ tools offer access to the Windows
clipboard,
the registry,
the event log,
relational databases,
document properties, and
shell links.

You can find compiled executables and formatted documentation on the project's
[web page](http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/outwit/).
